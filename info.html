      <p> Hello and Welcome! <br> I'm a current pre-med student trying to survive the rough and stressful college life.
        Although I like to say I'm a true CALI girl at heart since I grew up there for 9 years, I'm currently living
        in the small suburbs near Atlanta, Georgia. Just having turned 20, I'm trying to be more ~adult~ and am here to document my experiences on this blog.
        Always having been into the "beauty and lifestyle" industry that has recently become a lot more prominent in our community,
        I aspire to documet my experiences. From my monthly eats to favorite fashion staples, I hope to share a bit of my insight on
        what I love.</p>

      <p> I'm truly an introvert at heart (INFJ/ISTJ Meyers Briggs!!) and trying to ween myself off of SWEET coffe, although I haven't had much success.
            In the very rare free time that I have, I enjoy dancing and rewatching the same few Netflix shows. I tend to always put a lot on my plate and
            get stressed very easily, but there are always ways to grow and improve as a person!! I'm slowly learning what it means to take care of myself
            and I hope that this blog not only keeps track of my progress but gives some sort of insight to others reading. Thanks for reading and once again,
          welcome!</p>
