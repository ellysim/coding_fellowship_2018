          <p> Hello and Welcome! <br>
              I am a current pre-med student trying to survive the rough and stressful college life.
                Although I like to say I am a true CALI girl at heart since I grew up there for 9 years, I am currently living
                in the small suburbs near Atlanta, Georgia. Just having turned 20, I am trying to be more ~adult~ and am here to document my experiences on this blog.
                Always having been into the ~beauty and lifestyle~ industry that has recently become a lot more prominent in our community,
                I aspire to documet my experiences. From my monthly eats to favorite fashion staples, I hope to share a bit of my insight on
              what I love.</p>

          <p> I am truly an introvert at heart (INFJ/ISTJ Meyers Briggs!!) and trying to ween myself off of SWEET coffe, although I have not had much success.
                In the very rare free time that I have, I enjoy dancing and rewatching the same few Netflix shows. I tend to always put a lot on my plate and
                get stressed very easily, but there are always ways to grow and improve as a person!! I am slowly learning what it means to take care of myself
                and I hope that this blog not only keeps track of my progress but gives some sort of insight to others reading. Thanks for reading and once again,
              welcome!</p>
