        <h2 class='title'>May 2018 Eats</h2> <br>

        <p>It's been forever my goal to try to eat healthy and shed off some pounds. However, I haven't had much luck.
            With finals hitting beginning of May along with my six day break back at home, I've definitely managed to put on some weight after
            eating so much. As I'm finally getting into the routine of things here in St. Louis, I've been making an effort to cook not only to save
            money but also to eat healthier. The school year has definitely made me beyond dependent on sugar from all the cookies at the Whisper's Cafe,
            and I'm really hoping that I can kick this sugar addiction out of my life and replace some terrible eating habits with better ones.</p> <br>

        <p> As I've been subletting from my friend who has just moved in, I definitely haven't had chances to experiment with different recipes.
            My meals have basically been consistent of chicken, spinach, and brocolli, with a scrambeled egg as my "base". If I felt fancy or
            wanted a bit more food, I'd either add half an avocado or an extra boiled egg. And I can't ever forget my sriracha to top off the meal!
            I'm hoping that the rest of summer will be me experimenting a lot more with healthy recipes instead of repeating this same meal for the
            rest of my life, and hope to expand my range of food that I can cook. Although I may seem like I'm JUST eating healthy, I recently went
            back home for six days. Those six days were basically spent lounging around and stuffing my face with whatever food I could possibly find.
            From oysters and the Mardi Gras pasta at Papadeux (the best pasta and shrimp I've had to be honest) to boba and kbbq, I pushed my limits with
            how much food I could stuff in one sitting. I'll definitely be deprived of great boba and my mom's homemade Korean food, but I hope to explore
            the food scene in St. Louis a little more as I continue to work in the city for the rest of the summer! </p>
