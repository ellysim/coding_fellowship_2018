      <h2 class="title">Goals to Accomplish This Summer</h2> <br>
      <img src="images/IMG_7571.jpg" alt="fellowship" width= "500px" height= "400px"> <br>
      <p>This summer, I will be staying in St. Louis, participating in the Less Annoying CRM Coding Fellowship program.
            Over the next two months, we'll be learning the basics of building a website and hopefully get to build our own.
            As I work here at LACRM, I hope to accomplish some other goals outside of just work and premed, learning to
            destress and have some fun exploring this summer!!<br>

          Besides making a website, I'm determined to utilize this summer and make the most out of the short break that I have.
          As a bunch of my friends happen to be staying here this year, we've basically made a bucket list of things that we
          want to do this summer.</p>

      <ol style="list-style-tipe:1">
          <li>Get my doubles pierced</li>
          <li>Six Flags</li>
          <li>Go to Chicago</li>
          <li>Exercise at least 4 times a week</li>
          <li>Go stargazing</li>
          <li>Get my driver's licensce</li>
          <li>Marvel Marathon</li>
          <li>Travel with June to Boston</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Although there really is not a huge chance that I'll be able to get all of this done along with working a full 9-5 job,
        working part time at Kayaks, and taking MedPrep II - although it is still up for grabs - I hope to at least get some fun
        time in with friends!!</p>
